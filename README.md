## Solutions to exercises

- Source code for questions in `src/main/solutions.scala`
- Tests in `src/test/tests.scala`

## Running the code

- Assuming you're using `sbt`, this is simple:
    - Compile with `sbt compile`
    - Run with `sbt run` (this will generate 3 files, `Q1Output.txt`, `Q2Output.txt` and `Q3Output.txt`, one file per question)
    - Run tests with `sbt test`
